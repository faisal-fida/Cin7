### **Integration Requirements for Cin7 Core and WooCommerce**

#### **1. Order Synchronization:**
   - **Real-time Sync for Order Statuses:**
     - Sync all orders created with the following statuses:
       - **Processing**
       - **On-Hold**
       - **Delivered Not Paid**
       - **Paid Not Delivered**
       - **Installments**
       - **PC Build Processing**
       - **Reservation**
     - Exclude syncing of orders with the statuses:
       - **Draft**
       - **Pending Payments**

   - **Automatic Updates for Orders:**
     - When an order is created in WooCommerce, it should sync to Cin7 as a sales order.
     - Any updates to the order items in WooCommerce should reflect automatically in Cin7 (e.g., changing from a 1 TB SSD to a 2 TB SSD).

   - **Comprehensive Order Updates:**
     - Ensure that the following order stages sync to Cin7:
       - **Order**
       - **Picked**
       - **Packed**
       - **Shipped**
     - Once the order is completed, it should sync as a **Credit Note** and close the sales order in Cin7.

#### **2. Product Synchronization:**
   - **Automatic Product Imports:**
     - When a new product is added in WooCommerce, it should automatically be imported to Cin7 without requiring manual action to press the update button.
     - The product import process should be efficient to avoid long processing times (currently taking hours).

   - **Inventory Updates:**
     - Ensure that any changes made in WooCommerce (e.g., product updates) should reflect in Cin7, keeping the inventory data synchronized.

#### **3. API Customization:**
   - Explore potential customization of the Cin7 API to enhance the integration functionality, particularly for:
     - Real-time order and product synchronization.
     - Streamlining processes to reduce manual updates and intervention.




### **Tasks for Cin7 Core and WooCommerce Integration**

#### **1. Setup and Configuration:**
- **Familiarize with APIs:**
  - Review the Cin7 API documentation and WooCommerce API documentation.
  
- **Development Environment:**
  - Set up your development environment (IDE, libraries, etc.).
  - Ensure you have access to a test instance of both WooCommerce and Cin7.

#### **2. Order Synchronization:**
- **Implement Order Status Sync:**
  - Develop a function to sync orders from WooCommerce to Cin7 based on the specified statuses.
  - Exclude orders with **Draft** and **Pending Payments** statuses.

- **Create Order Update Handler:**
  - Implement a webhook or scheduled task that triggers when an order in WooCommerce is updated.
  - Ensure this updates the corresponding sales order in Cin7 (including item changes).

- **Order Stage Synchronization:**
  - Create functionality to sync order stages (Order, Picked, Packed, Shipped) to Cin7.
  - Implement logic to sync a **Credit Note** and close the sales order upon completion.

#### **3. Product Synchronization:**
- **Automatic Product Import:**
  - Develop a feature that automatically imports new products from WooCommerce to Cin7.
  - Optimize the product import process to ensure it is efficient.

- **Inventory Synchronization:**
  - Implement functionality to sync inventory updates from WooCommerce to Cin7 when product changes occur.

#### **4. API Customization:**
- **Enhance API Functionality:**
  - Identify any additional customization needed in the Cin7 API to meet client requirements.
  - Work on API calls to improve synchronization performance and reliability.

#### **5. Testing:**
- **Unit Testing:**
  - Write unit tests for all new functionalities to ensure they work as expected.

- **Integration Testing:**
  - Test the integration between WooCommerce and Cin7 to validate the synchronization of orders and products.
  
- **Error Handling:**
  - Implement error handling to manage failures in syncing (e.g., logging, retry mechanisms).

#### **6. Documentation:**
- **Document the Integration Process:**
  - Create documentation for the integration workflow, including API endpoints used and data mapping.
  
- **Client Communication:**
  - Prepare a summary of the completed tasks and their outcomes for client updates.

#### **7. Deployment:**
- **Deploy Changes:**
  - Once testing is complete, deploy the integration to the production environment.
  
- **Monitor Performance:**
  - Monitor the integration post-deployment for any issues and gather feedback for improvements.
